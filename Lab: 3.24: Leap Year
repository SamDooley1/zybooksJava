/* A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days. In reality, the earth takes longer to rotate around the sun. To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap year takes place. A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th. The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:

1) The year must be divisible by 4

2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400; therefore, both 1700 and 1800 are not leap years

Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.

Write a program that takes in a year and determines whether that year is a leap year.

Ex: If the input is:

1712
the output is:

1712 - leap year
Ex: If the input is:

1913
the output is:

1913 - not a leap year */

      // If a year is divisible by 4,  then it is a leap year

       if ((inputYear % 4) == 0) {
           isLeapYear = true;
       }
       // If a year is divisible by 100,  then it is not a leap year

       if ((inputYear % 100) == 0) {
           isLeapYear = false;
       }
       // If a year is divisible by 400,  then it is a leap year

       if ((inputYear % 400) == 0) {
           isLeapYear = true;
       }
       if (isLeapYear) {
           System.out.println(inputYear + " - leap year");
       }
       else {
           System.out.println(inputYear + " - not a leap year");
